# We provoke an overflow into the first chunck to overwrite the following one with a GOT address.
# Then the 2nd strcpy will write inside the GOT address the value of the second argument.
# Our crafted GOT address is then called at the end of the main function.
# This new GOT address redirect to the "m" function who will display the content of fgets (the password) for us.
