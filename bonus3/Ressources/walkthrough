$ 

This program reads the password, then compares our first parameter with the password read.
Before that, we can write a '\0' anywhere in the password read, with our argument, thanks to this code:
*(buffer + atoi(argv[1])) = 0; // buffer is where the real password is stored
At the end, the program performs a strcmp(buffer, argv[1]);
If we give an empty string with just "\0" in it, then atoi will return 0 and a '\0' will be placed at the beginning of the password buffer
So the password buffer will look like : ""
Since it's the same as our argv[1], the strcmp check will be passed and a shell will be executed through execl.
