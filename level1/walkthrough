We use gdb, nm and strings on our kali to deeply analyze the target binary.
We found a reference to system syscall and a buffer.
We fulfill incrementally the buffer until an overflow is found.
We then craft our exploit, following the calling convention, with :
	- a string overflow
	- the address of the reference to "system" syscall
	- the address of the reference to "exit" syscall
	- the address of the string "/bin/sh"
