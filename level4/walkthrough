Following the analysis of the code, we see a fgets and a printf. Here, we can't exploit the fgets, it's a secured function.
We see the cmp between a random value and an address in another segment.
We decide to exploit the printf thanks to reverse format string.
The "%n" formatter let us write into it the value we want so we craft the address of the value to be used a reference by printf, following enough noise to equal the target.
The "$" flag let us lead printf arg directly on the fourth stack argument, the our.

So to build our exploit we use :
- python -c 'print "\x8c\x98\x04\x08" + "A"*60  + "%4$n"' > /tmp/payload2
